## Overview

SE7O-SNA Panel manages VLESS inbounds and subscription links from one dashboard. Version 2
replaces the single-file design of v1 with a modular package: configuration, database access,
state, security, routes, and background services each live in their own module, while the web UI
remains a single embedded HTML template. Deployment is unchanged — push the repository to any
container platform and set a handful of environment variables. No database server, reverse proxy,
or build pipeline is required.

## Features

**Access control**
Username and password login, JWT sessions in HTTP-only cookies, a rate-limited login endpoint, an enforced
password policy, and an audit log of every login attempt with IP and user agent.

**Inbound management**
Create, edit, enable, disable, and delete VLESS configurations. Set per-inbound traffic quotas,
expiry dates, and concurrent-connection limits. Override path, SNI, host, and TLS fingerprint
individually, add packet-fragmentation ranges against DPI, and assign country flags. Bulk actions
cover activation, quota resets, and deletion. Inbounds can be exported to and imported from JSON.

**Analytics**
Live upload and download charts, 24-hour timezone-aware traffic history, per-inbound
distribution, monthly quota tracking, and CPU, memory, and disk monitoring.

**Clean IP list**
Add, edit, bulk-import, and bulk-delete IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that are attached to generated
subscriptions. A default set of clean addresses is seeded on first run and can be cleared or
replaced entirely from the dashboard.

**Per-user page**
Every inbound has a public page at `/user/{uid}` showing status, data usage, expiry, a QR code,
and one-tap copy buttons for the subscription and single VLESS links — shareable with end users
without granting panel access.

**Telegram notifications**
Bilingual (English/Persian) templates for panel logins, expired inbounds, errors, and quota
warnings, with a live template preview in the dashboard.

**Transports**
WebSocket (default) and XHTTP (Xray splithttp, stream-up mode) both run on the same HTTPS port —
no extra port needed. An optional raw-TCP VLESS listener (`type=tcp`, no TLS/WS framing) is
available on a second port for platforms that support exposing extra TCP ports (see
[Enable extra transports](#6-enable-extra-transports-optional) below).

**Telegram MTProxy**
An MTProto proxy (`mtg`) runs as a child process inside the same container. The FakeTLS secret is
generated on first start and persisted, and the panel builds the `tg://proxy` link automatically
from the platform's TCP proxy address. The MTProxy tab shows process state, the public endpoint,
a QR code, and lets you rotate the secret or change the fronting domain.

**Keep-alive**
Simple and advanced anti-sleep modes with a configurable interval, for platforms that idle out
free instances.

## Quick start

### 1. Fork

Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

### 2. Deploy

Connect the fork to a platform that supports WebSocket and Docker builds. The included
`Dockerfile` is detected automatically; no start command is needed.

Recommended platforms, none of which require a credit card or phone number:

| Platform | Free tier | Sleeps | Persistent volume |
|----------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Railway  | $5 credit / month | No, with keep-alive | Yes (1 GB) |
| Render   | 750 hours / month | Yes, after 15 min | Yes (1 GB) |
| Dockfly  | 1 project, 256 MB | No | Yes |
| Back4app | 0.25 CPU, 256 MB | No | No |
| Scalingo | 30-day trial | No | No |

Koyeb, Fly.io, Northflank, and Zeabur also work but require a card or phone number at signup.

### 3. Configure

Add these environment variables in the platform dashboard:

| Variable | Required | Example | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | Recommended | `se7oadmin` | Panel login username. Defaults to `admin`. |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Yes | `StrongPass!123` | Panel login password. Minimum 8 characters with upper case, lower case, and a digit. |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Yes | *(long random string)* | Signs JWT session cookies. If unset, a new key is generated on first start and stored in the database. |
| `DOMAIN` | Recommended | `se7o-sna.up.railway.app` | Public domain, used to build subscription links correctly. Auto-detected on Railway and Render. |
| `DB_PATH` | Recommended | `/data/panel.db` | SQLite file location. Mount a persistent volume at `/data` to keep data across restarts. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Optional | `postgres://…` | External PostgreSQL connection string. Overrides `DB_PATH`. |
| `PORT` | Optional | `8080` | Listening port. Most platforms inject their own value. |
| `MTPROXY_ENABLED` | Optional | `true` | Set to `false` to run the panel without the Telegram proxy. |
| `MTPROXY_PORT` | Optional | `443` | Port mtg binds to *inside* the container. This is the value you enter when creating the TCP proxy. |
| `MTPROXY_FAKE_DOMAIN` | Optional | `www.cloudflare.com` | Domain the FakeTLS secret impersonates. |
| `MTPROXY_SECRET` | Optional | `ee…` | Pin a specific secret instead of generating one. |
| `MTPROXY_PUBLIC_HOST` | Optional | `shuttle.proxy.rlwy.net` | Override the public host, for platforms that do not expose it automatically. |
| `MTPROXY_PUBLIC_PORT` | Optional | `15140` | Override the public port. |
| `XHTTP_ENABLED` | Optional | `true` | Enable the XHTTP transport, served on the same HTTPS port. Defaults to `true`. |
| `RAW_TCP_ENABLED` | Optional | `false` | Enable a second, plain `type=tcp` VLESS listener with no TLS/WS framing. Needs its own TCP proxy — see below. |
| `RAW_TCP_PORT` | Optional | `8080` | Port the raw-TCP listener binds to *inside* the container. |
| `RAW_TCP_PUBLIC_HOST` | Optional | `shuttle.proxy.rlwy.net` | Public host for the raw-TCP listener, for platforms that don't expose it automatically. |
| `RAW_TCP_PUBLIC_PORT` | Optional | `15141` | Public port for the raw-TCP listener. |

`ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and `SECRET_KEY` are read from the environment on **every**
startup, not just the first one: if you change one in the platform dashboard and redeploy, it
overrides whatever is currently stored in the database. Leave a variable unset to keep whatever
is already stored (or, on a brand-new deployment, the built-in default).

### 4. Enable the Telegram proxy

Railway can expose HTTP and TCP from the same service. In the service settings open
**Networking → TCP Proxy** and enter the *internal* port `443` (or whatever `MTPROXY_PORT` is set
to). Railway responds with a public address such as `shuttle.proxy.rlwy.net:15140`.

Nothing else is required. Railway injects `RAILWAY_TCP_PROXY_DOMAIN` and `RAILWAY_TCP_PROXY_PORT`
into the container, the panel reads them, and the MTProxy tab shows the finished link:

```
tg://proxy?server=shuttle.proxy.rlwy.net&port=15140&secret=ee…
```

The link must always carry that public address. The container's own IP is private and unreachable
from the internet, so it never appears in the link. Until a TCP proxy exists the tab shows a
warning and a provisional address.

On platforms that do not publish those variables, set `MTPROXY_PUBLIC_HOST` and
`MTPROXY_PUBLIC_PORT` yourself.

### 6. Enable extra transports (optional)

XHTTP works out of the box on the same HTTPS port — nothing to configure beyond
`XHTTP_ENABLED=true` (the default). Generate a link with transport `xhttp` from the dashboard the
same way you generate a `ws` link.

The raw-TCP transport is a second listener with its own port, so it needs the same kind of TCP
proxy as MTProxy:

1. Set `RAW_TCP_ENABLED=true` and, if you don't want the default, `RAW_TCP_PORT`.
2. In **Networking → TCP Proxy**, add a second proxy pointed at that internal port.
3. Put the public host/port Railway gives you into `RAW_TCP_PUBLIC_HOST` / `RAW_TCP_PUBLIC_PORT`.

Render's standard web service only exposes a single HTTP port, so the raw-TCP transport does not
work there — leave `RAW_TCP_ENABLED` off on Render.

### 7. Sign in

Open your deployment URL at `/panel` and log in with `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
Changing the password from **Settings** afterwards takes effect immediately and persists in the
database — just don't leave a stale `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var set to the old value, since that
will overwrite your in-panel change back on the next redeploy.

## Data persistence

Platforms with volume support keep the SQLite database across restarts — mount the volume at
`/data` and set `DB_PATH=/data/panel.db`. Where volumes are unavailable, set `DATABASE_URL` to an
external PostgreSQL instance instead; the application detects it at startup and uses it in place
of SQLite.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `main.py` | Entry point: logging, lifespan, app factory, and router registration. |
| `app/config.py` | Environment-driven configuration singleton. |
| `app/database.py` | Async SQLite/PostgreSQL abstraction and schema. |
| `app/state.py` | Centralized in-memory state and event log. |
| `app/security.py` | Bcrypt hashing, JWT creation, and the auth dependency. |
| `app/vless.py` | VLESS link generation, subscription content, and header parsing. |
| `app/utils.py` | Pure formatting and validation helpers. |
| `app/models.py` | Pydantic request models. |
| `app/routes/` | HTTP and WebSocket endpoints, grouped by domain. |
| `app/services/` | Background loops: traffic, keep-alive, Telegram, link expiry. |
| `app/services/mtproxy.py` | MTProto proxy supervisor, secret handling, link building. |
| `app/services/raw_tcp.py` | Raw-TCP VLESS listener (`type=tcp`), independent of the main HTTP port. |
| `app/routes/tunnel.py` | WebSocket and XHTTP VLESS tunnel endpoints — the core proxy engine. |
| `app/templates/panel_html.py` | The embedded single-page admin frontend. |
| `app/templates/user_html.py` | The public per-user subscription page. |
| `app/static/img/` | Optimized logo and favicon assets. |
| `smoke_test.py` | End-to-end test suite against a running instance. |
| `test_mtproxy.py` | Unit tests for secrets, endpoint resolution and the supervisor. |

## Local development

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
DB_PATH=./panel.db ADMIN_USERNAME=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=Test1234 python main.py
```

The panel is then served at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/panel`.

To run the test suite, start the server on port 8899 with username `se7oadmin` and password
`Test1234`, then run:

```bash
python smoke_test.py
```

The MTProxy unit tests need no server and no Docker:

```bash
python test_mtproxy.py
```

## Bandwidth costs

The panel is free; outbound bandwidth is billed by your hosting provider. Approximate figures,
subject to change — always confirm on the provider's pricing page.

| Platform | Included bandwidth | Cost per extra GB |
|----------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Railway  | Pay as you go | ~$0.10 |
| Render   | 5 GB / month | ~$0.10 |
| Back4app | 100 GB / month | See provider |
| Dockfly  | Not specified | See provider |
| Scalingo | Not specified | See provider |

Use per-inbound quotas to keep consumption predictable.
