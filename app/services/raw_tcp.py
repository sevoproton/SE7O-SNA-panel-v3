"""
Raw-TCP VLESS listener (type=tcp, no TLS/WS/HTTP framing at all).

This is a second, independent TCP server bound to its own port
(RAW_TCP_PORT, default 8080) — the same pattern the MTProxy service already
uses for its own port. IMPORTANT: binding the port inside this process is
only half the story. For clients to actually reach it, the *host platform*
also has to forward an external port to it:

  - Railway: Settings -> Networking -> "TCP Proxy" on this service, pointed
    at RAW_TCP_PORT. Railway will hand you a public host:port pair (often a
    different public port than RAW_TCP_PORT) — put those into
    RAW_TCP_PUBLIC_HOST / RAW_TCP_PUBLIC_PORT so generated links use the
    right address. This is exactly how the existing MTProxy 443 port is
    exposed in this project already.
  - Render: web services only expose a single HTTP port. Render does not
    support extra raw TCP ports on the standard web service type, so
    RAW_TCP_ENABLED should stay off there.

If RAW_TCP_ENABLED is on but the platform doesn't forward the port, the
listener still runs fine inside the container — it's just unreachable from
the internet, and generated vless:// tcp links won't connect.
